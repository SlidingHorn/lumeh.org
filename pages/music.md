# Recommended listening

[Good Stuff] is a ~30 minute playlist of what I consider to be my best work. If
you're short on time, just listen to the first two or three.

*   *Glimmering Pavement* – February 2018

    I started writing this on my phone during the bus rides home from work, and
    then moved to my usual computer workflow after I had a few ideas.  In lieu
    of a better animation, I've just done a screen capture of the playlist in FL
    Studio.

## 2017

*   *Swimming in Circles* – April 2017

    The soundtrack for
    [Something's Fishy](https://github.com/kalgynirae/somethings-fishy), a game
    I made for Ludum Dare 38.  I wrote this in about two hours, and then spent
    an additional 20 minutes after the submission deadline adding an actual
    ending and cleaning things up very slightly.  I'm pretty happy with how it
    turned out given the time limit, but I don't think it's as good as my other
    recent tracks.

## 2016

*   *Storm in the Valley* – August 2016

    I made the original *Battle in the Cathedral* using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/)
    instead of FL Studio, but I was never quite happy with how the final mix
    turned out. So I exported the individual instrument tracks and mixed them
    again in FL Studio, yielding this.

    They didn't end up using this one, though.

    This was a very silly song about heros liking breakfast food. I was given
    the lyrics and then wrote this.

## 2013

*   *Food Cart* – July 2013

    I finally finished the older track "battle music (rough draft)". I got a
    little bit carried away with the chords toward the end of the saxophone
    solo, and then the part after that references the melody and chords from
    "Black Hole" (but it's kind of difficult to pick out).

*   *Black Hole* – May 2013  
    for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway].

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">

    The beginning of this track is intended to accompany a short (roughly 10
    seconds) cutscene in which the black hole appears and steals some parts
    from your ship. The remainder of the track is a background music loop for
    the game's overworld.

    This is an orchestration of [Joey Franco's town theme], which was
    originally written for piano. He's slightly upset because I messed up part
    of the chord progression. In my defense, I'm still planning to fix it if I
    ever end up working on this again.

    I tried this after listening to the soundtrack for *Memphis* (the musical)

    was tricky because the saxophone sample I was using only did short notes.

    This track is an extension of the older *On The Clock* that matches up

    Anthony Narciso, Jeffrey Narciso, and I had a contest to see who could
    write the coolest track in an hour. We constrained ourselves thusly: (1)
    must include a pitched instrument; (2) must include drums; (3) must be
    loudest at the end. I gave myself the additional constraint that all of my
    layers needed to sound good together. It turned out okay…

    Written for my high school Latin project. There's one obvious mistake in
