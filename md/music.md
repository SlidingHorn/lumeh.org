[Good Stuff] is a ~30 minute playlist of what I consider to be my best work. If
you're short on time, just listen to the first two or three.

## 2016

*   *Storm in the Valley* – August 2016

    Based on the Gerudo Valley theme from Ocarina of Time. See the description
    of the YouTube video for more information.

*   *Battle in the Cathedral (Remastered)* – October 2015

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Battle in the Cathedral (Remastered).ogg">
    </audio>

    I made the original *Battle in the Cathedral* using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/)
    instead of FL Studio, but I was never quite happy with how the final mix
    turned out. So I exported the individual instrument tracks and mixed them
    again in FL Studio, yielding this.

## 2014

*   *You're a Hero (Instrumental)* – January 2014  
    for Whosical the Musical at SwampCon 2014.

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - You're a Hero (Instrumental).mp3">

    They didn't end up using this one, though.

*   *Capes and Crepes (Instrumental)* – January 2014  
    for Whosical the Musical at SwampCon 2014.

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Capes and Crepes (Instrumental).mp3">
    </audio>

    This was a very silly song about heros liking breakfast food. I was given
    the lyrics and then wrote this.

## 2013

*   *Food Cart* – July 2013
    for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway].

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">

*   *Gravitational Conflict* – July 2013  
    for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway].

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Gravitational Conflict.ogg">
    </audio>

    I finally finished the older track "battle music (rough draft)". I got a
    little bit carried away with the chords toward the end of the saxophone
    solo, and then the part after that references the melody and chords from
    "Black Hole" (but it's kind of difficult to pick out).

*   *Black Hole* – May 2013  
    for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway].

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Black Hole.ogg">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Black Hole.mp3">
    </audio>

    The beginning of this track is intended to accompany a short (roughly 10
    seconds) cutscene in which the black hole appears and steals some parts
    from your ship. The remainder of the track is a background music loop for
    the game's overworld.

*   *Space* – January 2013  
    for [Mideast Sidearm Hideaway].

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Space.ogg">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Space.mp3">

    Title screen music, perhaps?

*   *Can't Hold Us (instrumental backing track)* – January 2013

      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Can't Hold Us (instrumental backing track).mp3">
    </audio>

    I made this for a friend who was writing his own words to it. Dunno if
    he ever finished recording it. This could still use some improvement.

## 2012

*   *Mountains In Space* – July 2012  
    for the [Minecraft Space Mountain video].

      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Town Theme (orchestrated, draft).mp3">
    </audio>

    This is an orchestration of [Joey Franco's town theme], which was
    originally written for piano. He's slightly upset because I messed up part
    of the chord progression. In my defense, I'm still planning to fix it if I
    ever end up working on this again.

*   *The Game* – March 2012

      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - The Game.ogg">

    This is a piano duet. [Sheet music](/music/sheets/the-game.pdf) is available.

    I was experimenting with the demo version of Notion 3. This is just a
    re-creation of my earlier track *Exploding Soda Machine*.

    This actually doesn't sound at all like shop music. It sounds more like
    credits or menu music.

*   *Christmas In July* – July 2011

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Christmas In July.ogg">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - Christmas In July.mp3">
    </audio>

    My first Christmas medley! Included tunes (in order of initial
    appearance—some overlap):

    *   God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen
    *   The First Noel
    *   Il est né
    *   Sing We Now of Christmas
    *   Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming
    *   Up on the House Top
    *   Jingle Bells
    *   Do You Hear What I Hear?
    *   Look Down (Les Misérables)
    *   Carol of the Bells
    *   Ding Dong Merrily on High

*   *experimental memphis* – July 2011

      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - experimental memphis.ogg">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - experimental memphis.mp3">
    </audio>

    I tried this after listening to the soundtrack for *Memphis* (the musical)
    a few times. I was just going for a sort of gospel-y feel, I guess. This
    was tricky because the saxophone sample I was using only did short notes.

*   *On The Clock (long version)* – June 2011

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">

      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - On The Clock (long version).mp3">
    </audio>

    This track is an extension of the older *On The Clock* that matches up
    perfectly with Ke$ha's *Tik Tok*. The added build-up section that starts
    about 2/3 of the way through is spiffy.

*   *RandyRacer* – May 2011

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - RandyRacer.ogg">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - RandyRacer.mp3">

    This is Randy Adams's theme song.

    This really needs to be re-balanced. Too much bass and horn.

    Anthony Narciso, Jeffrey Narciso, and I had a contest to see who could
    write the coolest track in an hour. We constrained ourselves thusly: (1)
    must include a pitched instrument; (2) must include drums; (3) must be
    loudest at the end. I gave myself the additional constraint that all of my
    layers needed to sound good together. It turned out okay…

    </audio>

    Written for David Troner's fish named Lucas. The ending (the last 17 or so
    seconds) is basically perfect.

## 2010

*   *God Stress Ye, Merry Mentlegen* – December 2010

    <audio controls="controls" preload="none">
      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - God Stress Ye, Merry Mentlegen.ogg">

    You don't think Christmas music can be annoying? Think again!

      <source src="/music/files/Synthmaster Lumpy - God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.mp3">
    </audio>

    As far as I can tell, this is the correct punctuation of the title.
    I wrote this in response to calzoneman's God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen. The
    ending explosion is the same as from *On The Clock*. It just sounded right.

    Written using the chords from Ke$ha's *Tik Tok*. I tried to hide this fact
    until the point in the middle where it becomes completely obvious.

*   *Latin Prepositions* – January 2010

    Written for my high school Latin project. There's one obvious mistake in
    this, where I say the wrong translation for "post montem". That was a
    recording mistake that I didn't notice until it was too late to fix. Oh
    well. I'm also not a big fan of my singing.
