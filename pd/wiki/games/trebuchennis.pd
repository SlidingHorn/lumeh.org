**Trebuchennis** is just like [tennis] except each player must bring a
[trebuchet] which he/she will use to serve the ball. The trebuchet may be placed
anywhere behind the baseline (see [tennis court lines]), but note that many
placements are undesirable because they impede the player. The trebuchet should
be easily movable since it will need to serve to both service boxes and to
switch sides of the court when the players do.
