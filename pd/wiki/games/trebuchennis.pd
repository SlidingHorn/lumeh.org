**Trebuchennis** is just like [tennis] except each player must bring one or more
[trebuchets] which he/she will use to serve the ball. The trebuchets may be
placed anywhere behind the baseline (see [tennis court lines]), but note that
many placements are undesirable because they impede the player. The trebuchets
should be easily movable since they will need to switch sides of the court with
their players.
