<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Thomas Edward was quite smart,<br />
But money had he none.<br />
So quick was he to answer when<br />
Zeus called and told him, “Son…</div>
<div class="line-block">“I’m having trouble reading books<br />
In the middle of the night.<br />
These lightning bolts burn holes right through;<br />
I need a softer light.</div>
<div class="line-block">“I asked some other people too,<br />
And when they weren’t enthused<br />
I decided I’d give a prize<br />
For whoever’s light I used.”</div>
<div class="line-block">Thomas thought it over,<br />
Then gave Zeus his reply:<br />
“I’ll make the best light ever made!<br />
Well, at least, I’ll try.”</div>
<div class="line-block">So Thomas set to work at once,<br />
To finish his design.<br />
He thought a bulb would work well,<br />
Since its shape was quite divine.</div>
<div class="line-block">He formed the bulb of lucid glass<br />
And being satisfied<br />
He took his only lightning bug<br />
And sealed it inside.</div>
<div class="line-block">But Thomas had a nemesis<br />
Of whom he did not know.<br />
And thus that night he left his bulb<br />
Unhidden from his foe.</div>
<div class="line-block">Next morning Thomas was distraught<br />
When, at the break of dawn,<br />
He saw his light bulb on the desk—<br />
The lightning bug was gone.</div>
<div class="line-block">“My light bulb having been ruined,<br />
Who knows what I shall do?”<br />
The angry Thomas Edward said.<br />
But Zeus replied, “I do.</div>
<div class="line-block">“You have failed my contest, sir,<br />
And that being the case,<br />
There’s only one thing left to do:<br />
I must kill you with this mace.”</div>
<div class="line-block">Thomas Edward cowered with fear<br />
And backed against a wall.<br />
But mighty Zeus just stood and laughed<br />
At his imminent downfall.</div>
<div class="line-block">Then Lumeh, God of Light Bulbs,<br />
In a blinding flash of light<br />
Appeared and said to Thomas,<br />
“Now lemme make things right.”</div>
<div class="line-block">He stood before the mighty Zeus.<br />
His eyes started to narrow.<br />
And with a frail buzzing sound,<br />
He began to brightly glow.</div>
<div class="line-block">Zeus’s eyes were blinded.<br />
Lumeh was alight;<br />
He suddenly exploded,<br />
But Thomas was alright.</div>
<div class="line-block">Thomas looked with wonder,<br />
For though Lumeh was defunct,<br />
To Thomas Edward’s light bulb<br />
A bright glowing was adjunct.</div>
<div class="line-block">So Zeus ordered his minions to<br />
The prize to Thomas bestow.<br />
And all light bulbs from that point forth<br />
Produced a useful glow.</div>
